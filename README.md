# machine-learning-and-security
Finnish notes for the book Machine Learning &amp; Security (Chio &amp; Freeman, 2018).

*Sometimes the pages fail to load. This is due to failure in serving large ipynb-files from Github to an external preview service. This is a Github-side problem, bu reload should alleviate it.*

*The chapter-wise notes should be viewable with mobile devices as well.*

## Why in Finnish and not in English?

The simple answer: To help native Finnish speakers grasp the consepts of machine learning better. There's a plethora of books and online courses already about the subjects. What is missing however is an all-around repository of machine learning talk in Finnish. And its a shame, as native Finns regularly resort to speaking fluent Finglish when discussing the topics of machine learning. This is why.
